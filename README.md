# 🧠 Machine Learning Notes and Code

This repository contains my personal notes and code examples from learning **Machine Learning** with Python. It covers essential libraries, fundamental concepts, and practical implementations using real datasets.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- 📊 **NumPy** – Arrays, vectorized operations  
- 🐼 **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- 📈 **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- 🧮 **Regression** – Linear, polynomial  
- 🧪 **Classification** – Logistic regression, k-NN, etc.  
- 🧩 **Clustering** – K-Means, DBSCAN, hierarchical  
- 🧰 **Scikit-learn** – Model training, evaluation, pipelines  
- 📊 **Data Analysis** – EDA, dataset insights, metrics
